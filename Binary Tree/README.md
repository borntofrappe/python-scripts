> Use the binary tree algorithm to create a maze.

## Development Notes

The binary tree algorithm is a simple, yet an intriguing one. It is also a treasure trove if you want to exercise with software. So far I have been able to practice with JavaScript, SVG and the data visualization library D3. [Here's the reference for that dollop](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/pen/OJVyMNR).

Here, I set out to use the algorithm to draw a similar maze. Just with Python and ASCII characters.
