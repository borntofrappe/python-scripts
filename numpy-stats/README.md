# NumPy Stats

> First project of five to earn the **Data Analysis with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.

The note introducing other projects for the freeCodeCamp certification is repeated here to be exhaustive:

- the freeCodeCamp curriculum is under development

- a link to the assignment will be included when the certification will be live

- there are actually two scripts. One created in the end of January 2020, one in June 2020 as I reviewed the project. The two differ since the project was updated with additional requirements, and since I've learned more about the Python language

## Assignment

In its revised version, the project asks to compute the following information for a 3x3 matrix:

- mean
- variance
- standard deviation
- max
- min

It also asks to calculate the sum of the rows, of the columns, and the items themselves.
