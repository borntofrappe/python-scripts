Plot data from Google Trends and using matplotlib.

## Notes

For the data I collected the information from Google Trends, looking at the search results for the words 'python' and 'snake' at a worldwide level, and for the previous 90 days.[Here's the link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&q=python,snake) for reference.

It is stored in `data.csv`, and I use the `pandas` library to retrieve and map the data into columns. I'm still inexperienced with `pandas`, and the project is actually a good excuse to get acquainted with the library.
