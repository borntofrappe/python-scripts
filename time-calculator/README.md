# Time Calculator

> Second project of five to earn the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.

_Please note_: The paragraph introducing the arithmetic formatter is valid here as well:

- the freeCodeCamp curriculum is under development

- a link to the project will be included when the certification is live

- there are actually two scripts. One created in the end of January 2020, one in June 2020 as I reviewed the project. This last one will be submitted to the freeCodeCamp platform, but it is teaching/intriguing to see how my solution has changed in light of the knowledge I gained in between the two dates.
