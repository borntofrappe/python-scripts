# Medical Data Visualizer

> Third project of five to earn the **Data Analysis with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.

The note introducing other projects for the freeCodeCamp certification is repeated here to be exhaustive:

- the freeCodeCamp curriculum is under development

- a link to the assignment will be included when the certification will be live

Similarly to the project **demographic-data-analyzer**, there is a `.csv` file describing the data, and this stores a subset of the original source data. Be sure to reference the path toward the file at the top of the script.

Unlike the same project, and the other in the freeCodeCamp series, there is only one solution for this assignment. I have not tackled this project in a previous version.
