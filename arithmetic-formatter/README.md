# Arithmetic Formatter

This project sets out to complete the first project of five necessary to earn the certification **Scientific Computing with Python Projects**. This on the freeCodeCamp curriculum. At the time of writing, the curriculum is not public yet, but I'll add a link as soon as it's made avaulalble.

_Please note_: there is more than one script, and this is because the assignment itself evolved since its first implementation.

## Scripts

### main

`main` highlights the actual program. It imports the necessary function, and prints out the output for a series of arithmetic operations.

### [arithmetic_arranger](https://repl.it/@borntofrappe/fcc-arithmetic-arranger)

`arithmetic_arranger` formats arithmetic operations in the desired structure, but it's not the final version of the project. This because I wrote the program in the end of January 2020. The assignment has been since modified, and therefore, I decided to revisit the project to comply with the changes.

It is also teaching and entertaining to see how my approach to the problem, and my reasoning with Python has changed since.

### arithmetic_formatter

WORK_IN_PROGRESS

`arithmetic_formatter` formats arithmetic operations, and is meant to be the program submitted to the freeCodeCamp platform.

## Assignment

A few words on the assignment itself. The goal of the project is to take a series of arithmetic expressions, proposed inline:

```
32 + 698
```

And lay out the operations vertically

```
   32
+ 698
-----
```

The assignment has more details on the return values, and the appropriate error messages, but in essence, that is all the scripts are required to accomplish.
