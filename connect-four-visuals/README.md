- [python script](https://github.com/borntofrappe/python-scripts/tree/master/connect-four) creating the connect-four game in the terminal console. See [the matching REPL](https://repl.it/@borntofrappe/connect-four) for a live demo.

- [Tutorial](https://youtu.be/XGf2GcyHPhc?t=5705) on the [freecodecamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) inspiring the project.

  Inspiring, but once again not driving the project. This is a follow up to the mentioned python script, and I plan to try my best at developing the game before reviewing the video.
