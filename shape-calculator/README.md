# Shape Calculator

> Third project of five to earn the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.

The note introducing the projects **arithmetic-formatter** and **time-calculator** is repeated here as well.

- the freeCodeCamp curriculum is under development

- a link to the assignment will be included when the certification will be live

- there are actually two scripts. One created in the end of January 2020, one in June 2020 as I reviewed the project. The two differ since the project was updated with additional requirements

## Assignment

This project allows to practice with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in the context of the Python language. Think classes, think objects. The goal is to create a class `Rectangle`, with two attributes and a variety of methods (more on this later). From this starting point, the project asks to also create another class, `Square`, and have it inherit the previous class attributes and methods.
