## Notes

This project is being developed while going through [this tutorial on pygame](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w), to get acquainted with the module.

There are quite a few differences from the actual tutorial, as I tried my luck exploring a series of topics connected with the python language. In terms of visuals, I decided to draw shapes instead of using stock images, and this has actually brought me to consider how to slow down the rate at which the shapes are updated. Since the draw function accepts only integer, I resolved to update the integer at a slower rate.
