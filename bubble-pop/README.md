# Bubble Pop

> a space invaders clone

## Notes

This project is being developed while going through [this tutorial on pygame](https://youtu.be/FfWpgLFMI7w), to get acquainted with the module.

There are some differences from the actual tutorial, as I tried my luck exploring a series of topics connected with the python language:

- dict
- list
- class

The biggest visual difference from the game is that I chose not to use stock images, and instead drew every asset with a circle.
