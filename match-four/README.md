# Match Four

A game in which you are tasked to match shapes of the same color.

## Notes

This project is inspired by [this tutorial]() on [freecodecamp YouTube channel]() and it is actually scheduled to produce two games.

## Terminal

Using ASCII characters, the idea is to show a grid of `n` columns and , filled with empty spaces. Select a column typing the matching integer, and have a space filled with the selected color.
