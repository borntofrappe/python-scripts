# Match Four

A game in which you are tasked to match shapes of the same color.

## Notes

This project is inspired by [this tutorial]() on [freecodecamp YouTube channel]() and it is actually scheduled in two variants. The first variant uses the console, the terminal to play the game, while the second one replicates the logic with more visuals in pygame.
