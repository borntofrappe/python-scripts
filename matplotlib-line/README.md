# Matplotlib line

Plot data from Google Trends with a line chart and matplotlib.

## Notes

For the data I collected the information from Google Trends, looking at the search results for the words 'python' and 'snake' at a Worldwide level, and in the timeframe `["2020-03-24", "2020-06-24"]`. [Here's a link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2020-03-24%202020-06-24&q=python,snake) for reference.
