## Notes

This project is a revision of the code produced following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/XGf2GcyHPhc?t=79) on [freeCodeCamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ).

While the tutorial was extremely teaching, I wasn't satisfied with the end result, and decided to rewrite the code using classes. You can find the first version in the aptly named **tutorial** folder, but it follows the video pretty closely. The only difference is the use of [_lambda expressions_](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html?highlight=lambda#lambda-expressions), a way I picked up to avoid repeating myself too much.
