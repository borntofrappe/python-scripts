# Budget App

> Fourth project of five to earn the **Scientific Computing with Python** certification on freeCodeCamp.

The note introducing other projects for the freeCodeCamp certifications is repeated here to be exhaustive:

- the freeCodeCamp curriculum is under development

- a link to the assignment will be included when the certification will be live

- there are actually two scripts. One created in the end of January 2020, one in June 2020 as I reviewed the project. The two differ since the project was updated with additional requirements, and since I've learned more about the Python language

## Assignment

This project allows to practice with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in the context of the Python language.
